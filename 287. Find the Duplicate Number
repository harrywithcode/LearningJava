//The main idea is the same with problem Linked List Cycle II,https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/. 
Use two pointers the fast and the slow. The fast one goes forward two steps each time, while the slow one goes only step each time. 
They must meet the same item when slow==fast. In fact, they meet in a circle, 
the duplicate number must be the entry point of the circle when visiting the array from nums[0]. 
Next we just need to find the entry point. We use a point(we can use the fast one before) to visit form begining with one step each time, 
do the same job to slow. When fast==slow, they meet at the entry point of the circle. The easy understood code is as follows.


class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length - 1;
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;
        int mid;
        
        while (low < high) {
            mid = (low + high) / 2;
            int count = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num <= mid){
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count>mid) {
                high = mid;
            } //it means the duplicated value is in前半部分
            else {
                low = mid + 1;
            } //后半部分
        }
        return low;
    }
}
//类似于二分法，时间复杂度是O(nlogN)
