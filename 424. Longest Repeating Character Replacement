The problem says that we can make at most k changes to the string (any character can be replaced with any other character). So, let's say there were no constraints like the k. Given a string convert it to a string with all same characters with minimal changes. The answer to this is

length of the entire string - number of times of the maximum occurring character in the string
Given this, we can apply the at most k changes constraint and maintain a sliding window such that

(length of substring - number of times of the maximum occurring character in the substring) <= k
